What
 
is
 
a
 
Network?
 
○
 
A
 
computer
 
network
 
is
 
a
 
collection
 
of
 
computers
 
interconnected
 
via
 
a
 
transmission
 
medium.
 
●
 
Types
 
of
 
Networks
 
○
 
LAN
 
(Local
 
Area
 
Network):
 
a
 
network
 
that
 
covers
 
a
 
relatively
 
small
 
area.
 
Usually
 
characterized
 
by
 
high-speed
 
transmission
 
and
 
usually
 
connected
 
with
 
switches
 
and
 
hubs
 
■
 
Distance
 
characterizes
 
this
 
network
 
○
 
MAN
 
(Metropolitan
 
area
 
networks):
 
network
 
that
 
covers
 
medium
 
sized
 
areas
 
(perhaps
 
1-10
 
square
 
miles).
 
Characterized
 
by
 
medium-to-high
 
transmission
 
speeds
 
 
○
 
WAN
 
(Wide-Area
 
Network):
 
a
 
network
 
that
 
typically
 
covers
 
large
 
distances
 
(100+
 
miles).
 
Lower
 
speeds
 
than
 
LANs
 
or
 
MANs.
 
■
 
Ex.
 
The
 
Internet,
 
A
 
Provider
 
Network
 
like
 
Verizon
 
●
 
Why
 
use
 
Networks?
 
○
 
Availability
 
of
 
resources:
 
■
 
Ex.
 
sharing
 
resources
 
like
 
multiple
 
people
 
connecting
 
to
 
a
 
printer,
 
letting
 
multiple
 
people
 
access
 
a
 
folder,
 
etc.
 
 
○
 
Load
 
sharing
 
■
 
Ex.
 
split
 
processes
 
between
 
multiple
 
servers
 
○
 
High
 
reliability
 
■
 
Ex.
 
if
 
one
 
server
 
goes
 
down
 
can
 
use
 
another
 
○
 
Human
 
to
 
human
 
communication
 
■
 
Ex.
 
WhatsApp,
 
etc.
 
●
 
Connectivity
 
○
 
Point-to-Point
 
can
 
only
 
have
 
one
 
connection
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
○
 
Multiple
 
Access
 
■
 
There
 
are
 
Network
 
collisions,
 
performance
 
drops,
 
but
 
obviously
 
more
 
efficient
 
when
 
needing
 
to
 
access
 
multiple
 
people
 
●
 
Switched
 
Networks
 
○
 
Circuit
 
Switched
 
○
 
Packet
 
switched:
 
 
●
 
Cost-Effective
 
Resource
 
Sharing
 
○
 
Frequency
 
Divided
 
Multiplexing
 
■
 
Got
 
small
 
portion
 
of
 
network
 
for
 
the
 
whole
 
time
 
○
 
Time
 
Divided
 
Multiplexing
 
■
 
Split
 
up
 
depending
 
on
 
time,
 
get
 
whole
 
signal
 
for
 
a
 
certain
 
time
 
slot
 
●
 
Protocols
 
○
 
Think
 
of
 
following
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
rules
 
when
 
an
 
emergency
 
happens,
 
or
 
how
 
to
 
deal
 
with
 
certain
 
events
 
○
 
Networks
 
go
 
through
 
protocols
 
to
 
exchange
 
data
 ○
 
Different
 
router
 
companies
 
like
 
Cisco
 
and
 
others
 
follow
 
the
 
same
 
protocols
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
networks
 
work
 
together
 
○
 
There
 
are
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
protocols
 
that
 
work
 
together
 
to
 
facilitate
 
communication
 
○

(Internet
 
Protocol
 
addressing)
 
●
 
An
 
IP
 
address
 
does
 
not
 
identify
 
a
 
specific
 
computer.
 
Instead,
 
each
 
IP
 
address
 
identifies
 
a
 
connection
 
between
 
a
 
computer
 
and
 
a
 
network
 
●
 
A
 
computer
 
with
 
multiple
 
network
 
connections
 
(e.eg.,
 
a
 
router)
 
must
 
be
 
assigned
 
one
 
IP
 
address
 
for
 
each
 
connectin
 
●

are:
 
○
 
Virtual
 
(they
 
are
 
only
 
understood
 
by
 
software)
 
○
 
Used
 
for
 
all
 
communication
 
in
 
TCP/IP
 
○
 
32-bit
 
integers*
 
○
 
Unique
 
for
 
each
 
host
 
●
 
Note
 
○
 
IPv4
 
uses
 
32-bit
 
IP
 
addresses
 
○
 
IPv6
 
uses
 
128-bit
 
IP
 
addresses.
 
●
 
IP
 
addresses
 
are
 
divided
 
into
 
two
 
parts
 
○
 
Prefix
 
-
 
which
 
identifies
 
the
 
network
 
○
 
Suffix
 
-
 
which
 
identifies
 
the
 
host
 
●
 
The
 
Internet
 
Assigned
 
Number
 
Authority
 
is
 
the
 
global
 
authority
 
that
 
has
 
control
 
over
 
the
 
assignment
 
a
 
unique
 
prefix
 
to
 
each
 
network
 
●
 
A
 
local
 
administrator
 
assigns
 
a
 
unique
 
suffix
 
to
 
each
 
host.
 
●
 
The
 
IP
 
hierarchy
 
guarantees
 
that:
 
●
 
Each
 
computer
 
is
 
assigned
 
a
 
unique
 
address
 
●
 
Suffixes
 
can
 
be
 
assigned
 
locally
 
without
 
global
 
coordination

The
 
initial
 
bits
 
The
 
initial
 
bits
 
determine
 
the
 
class
 
of
 
the
 
address
 
●
 
The
 
class
 
determines
 
the
 
boundary
 
between
 
prefix
 
and
 
suffix
 ●

Question:
 
How
 
do
 
we
 
know
 
which

an

Main
 
Concept:
 
instead
 
of
 
having
 
three
 
distinct
 
address
 
classes
 
(A
 
B
 
and
 
C),
 
allow
 
the
 
division
 
between
 
prefix/suffix
 
to
 
concur
 
on
 
an
 
arbitrary
 
bit
 
boundary.
